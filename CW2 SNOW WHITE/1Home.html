  </p>
<div>
  <!--below is the beginnings of the coding for the name changer this was put together using HTML, and javascript that was 
  sourced by ChatGPT, this has been referenced in the footer and report, the creator tried many ways to get the code to work herself, but nothing worked 
in the end, help was needed; there hasn't been a change to the html and the javascript side as every 
 attempt to adapt it, resulting in the code not functioning; the styles for this function, however, was put together 
by the creator,

the name changer was crucial to the story design as the heart of this story is that the reader 
is included in the story which would help them enjoy it more-->
    <input class="wordchange" type="text" id="newWord" placeholder="Entre Name">
    <button class="button3" id="submitBtn">Submit</button>
</div>

<!--the name changer was crucial to the story design as it is to help people who have
difficulties with reading and those who are blind; the creator was going to record her own voice but realised 
an audio recording would not update and put the new names in-->
    <br><p id="story"><!--the id story is to help the name replacer know where to look for the name it is changing from-->
    For example, Welcome, Leona!
    <br><br></p>
    <p>
    Below are also two buttons you will find on all Chapters, 
    once you have changed your name, click on the start reading button 
    will read the story aloud to you, including your name.
    <br><br>
    <div>
   <!--below are the beginnings of the code for the automatic reader; this was also sourced from ChatGPT and reference in the footer and report
  the creator tried to find help for this kind of code but couldn't find anything that worked, needed as part of
   the stories design as it is to help people who have difficulties with reading and those who are blind, 
   the creator was going to record her own voice but released an audio recording that would not update and put the new names in, 
  both the reader and name replacer was part of the original design, however, the creator 
underestimated how hard it would be to achieve this code is still not to the standard the creator appaired to
as the name charger needs to be added onto each page but does still give that personal touch of adding the reader 
into the story-->
    <button class="button1" id="startButton"><strong>Start Reading</strong></button>
     <button class="button2" id="stopButton"><strong>Stop Reading</strong></button>
    </div>

    <!--below is an image that starts off small and becomes bigger and adds some charm to the home page,
    the creator found she sometimes needed to add some styling into HTML and 
  there was some difficulty getting some images placed in the middle of the page by adding
it in HTML the desired outcome was achieved -->
      <div>
        <center>
          <img class="Cert1" src="image\5CT7Cert1.png" alt="Cert1" >
        </center>

<!--bottom buttons for next and previously were created by the help of W3Schools ref in the footer and report all styling for this 
has been created by the creator; this was added to help the reader navigate to the next page 
with ease and save the reader from going into the side menu-->
