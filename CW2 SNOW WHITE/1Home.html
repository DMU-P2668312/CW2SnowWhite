    However, before we begin, there are some things you should know,
    <br><br>
    below is the area you need to type your name into to become part of this story, 
    this can be found on each Chapter. Give it a go now.
    <br>
    put your name in below and see the name change to your own before your eyes.
    <br>
  </p>
<div>
  <!--below is the beginnings of the coding for the name changer this was put together using html, and javascript that was 
  sourced by ChatGPT this has been referance in foorter and report, the creater tried many ways to get the code to work herself but nothing worked 
in the end help was needed there hasnt been a change to the html and the javascript side as every 
 attempt to adapt it resulting is the code not fuctioning, the styles for this function however was put together 
by the creater,

the name changer was crucial to the stories design as the heart of this story is that the reader 
is included into the story which would help them enjoy it more-->
    <input class="wordchange" type="text" id="newWord" placeholder="Entre Name">
    <button class="button3" id="submitBtn">Submit</button>
</div>

<!--the name changer was crucial to the stories design as it is to help people who have
difficultys with reading and those who are blind, the creater was going to record her own voice but relised 
an audio recording would not update and put the new names in-->
    <br><p id="story"><!--the id story is to help the name replacer know where to look for the name it is changing from-->
    For example, Welcome, Leona!
    <br><br></p>
    <p>
    Below are also two buttons you will find on all Chapters, 
    once you have changed your name, click on the start reading button 
    will read the story aloud to you, including your name.
    <br><br>
    <div>
   <!--below are the beginnings of the code for the automatic reader this was also sourced from ChatGPT and referance in footer and report
  the creater tried to finf help for this kind of code but couldnt find anything that worked, needed as part of
   the stories design as it is to help people who have difficultys with reading and those who are blind, 
   the creater was going to record her own voice but relised an audio recording would not update and put the new names in, 
  bothe the reader and name replacer was part of the orginal design however the creater 
underestimated how hard it would be to achive this code is still not to the standard teh creater appaired to
as the name chager needs to be added onto each page but does still give that personal touch of adding the reader 
into teh story-->
    <button class="button1" id="startButton"><strong>Start Reading</strong></button>
     <button class="button2" id="stopButton"><strong>Stop Reading</strong></button>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <!--below is an image that starts of samll and becomes bigger and adds some charm to the home page,
    the creater found she somethimes needed to add some styling into html and 
  there was some difficulty getting some images placed in the middle of the page by adding
it in html the desired out come was acheved -->
      <div>
        <center>
          <img class="Cert1" src="image\5CT7Cert1.png" alt="Cert1" >
        </center>
