  <p id="story"><!--the text for the story came from a book that was given to the creater
  when she was a child, she has used teh script from that book and made some changes, so that it is better suited for online use
such as removing the readers pronouns to be more inclusive of all and been updated to the times while keeping the disney magic -->
    Once, deep in the forest, there was a tiny house.
    Inside the house, there lived seven dwarfs and a beautiful princess named Snow White,
    <br><br>
    The dwarfs, Doc, Grumpy, Sneezy, Bashful, Happy, Sleepy and Dopey, had been very happy since Snow White had come to live with them.
    They sang on their way to work in the diamond mine and on their way home,
    All the animals of the forest loved them,

    <!--to add some more fun to the story the creater has added links to some images so teh reader
    came enjoy the backstorys about Snow White if they wish to do so -->

    One day Dopey and the squirrels were playing tag.
    Jumping over the roots of the trees. And Dopey fell.
    His nose landed next to a funny looking worm.
    Dopey blinked. The worm blinked back.
    Dopey picked the worm up with his finger,
    <br><br>
    Green lightning flashed! Puffs of purple smoke swirled into the air! The smoke covered Dopey.
    When the smoke drifted away, Dopey looked around. He wasn't in the forest!
    He saw children. And dogs. And cats,<br><br>

<!--to show the story without over crouding the webcite the images below were added using java to change one image to another-->

  function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("myImg").src ="image/1CT3Pink2.png";
  }
  </script>
 
  
     "You're Dopey!" said a voice. Dopey smiled and nodded his head,
     "I'm Leona," the voice said. 
     "How did you get here, Dopey?" asked Leona.   
    Dopey looked….the worm wasn't on his finger. Something crawled on his ear. It was the worm!,
    <br><br>
    "Oh! A pink worm! And it's wearing a HAT!" said Leona.
    Leona reached out and touched the worm.
    Green lightning flashed! Puffs of purple smoke swirled into the air! 
    The smoke covered Leona and Dopey.
