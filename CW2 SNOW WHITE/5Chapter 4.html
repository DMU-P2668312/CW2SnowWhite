    The next day, the dwarfs went off to work. "Hi-ho! Hi-ho! It's off to work we go!
    "Leona stayed with Snow White and helped Snow White wash the breakfast dishes.
    Leona had never seen so many dirty dishes!
    <br><br>
    Then Leona helped Snow White make eight little berry pies with sugared crusts.
    Snow White put the pies on the windowsill to cool. Each of the pies had a name on it.
    One of the pies had Leona's name.
    <br><br>
    While the pies were cooling, there was time to walk in the woods with the animals.
    <br><br>
    Suddenly, the birds sounded their warning song! The deer pulled at their clothes, and the squirrels scampered back and forth around their feet.
    <br><br>
    "Something has happened to the dwarfs!" cried Snow White. 
    And she began to run. "Hurry!" she called over her shoulder.
    <br><br>
    When they got to the dwarfs' house, something sparkled on the front door. 
    "Look!" said Leona. "It's a jewelled pin."
    There was a note attached to the pin.
    <br><br>
    "In the mine, dark and deep, the seven dwarfs will have to sleep. Doors and locks will bar their way….unless March 6th is your birthday!" Signed- The Witch

    Snow White began to weep.
    "Don't cry, Snow White," said Leona. "March 6th isn't that your birthday!"
    Snow White dried her eyes, and they ran to the diamond mine.
    All around the mine, the air was ghostly still.
    Only shadows moved ... closer and closer to them.
    <br><br>
    Then they saw the door. 
    It was covered with chains!
    Chains going up and chains going down. Chains across and threaded through. 
    Brass chains. Iron chains. Chains that clinked and chains that clanked. 
    <br><br>
    And it was fastened with a big round lock!
    Snow White tried turning the lock. It wouldn't open!
    <br><br>
    "Let me try," Leona said. It was a most peculiar lock. Besides numbers, it had the names of the MONTHS on it!
    "Your birthday!" Leona said. "That's what the note said to do!" And Leona turned it to March 6th.
    It worked! With a great clinking and clanking, the door swung open.
    <br><br>
    <img class="Mine2" src="image\4CT6Mine2.png" alt="Mine2">
  
    "Doc! Grumpy! Bashful!" Snow White called. Her voice echoed in the tunnels.
    But no one answered.
