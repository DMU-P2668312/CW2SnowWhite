    When they reached the dwarfs' house, Happy gave Sneezy a big red handkerchief to put on his nose. 
    Sneezy kept on sneezing. 
    <br><br>
    Dopey got the goldfish bowl and put it over, Sneezy's head.
    It worked! Sneezy stopped sneezing. 
    But he couldn't get the bowl off his head! He tugged....and tugged....and tugged. It wouldn't come off!
    "Help!" he cried from inside the bowl.
    <br><br>
    Dopey looked around and saw the hay. He put some inside the bowl….. next to Sneezy's nose.
    "AH--AH--CHO0O" And the goldfish bowl flew right off Sneezys head.

    <br>
    Then it was time to eat dinner. While they were eating, 
    Leona told Snow White and the dwarfs about home.
    <br><br>
    Later, when they went to sleep, Sneezy dreamed about the hay.
    His nose itched and twitched. "AH—CHOO!" 
    He sneezed so loud that he woke everyone up except Sleepy.
    Leona took the big red handkerchief and tied it around Sneezy's nose.
    Grumpy gave everyone ear-muffs. And then they all went back to sleep.

  <!-- the animation/tranformations that was used on this image in css works well on laptop but
  isnt working on mobile, this could be due to may thing one being people have their animation and tranformations turned off,
  or something else or perhaps width in styling having trouble getting to the root of the problem, everything that has been changed
  to see if can get to work, stops other things working if had unlimited time would continue on this until it was sorted, will continue
