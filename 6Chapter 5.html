    They walked on and on, with only the diamond dust light to guide them.
    Suddenly, Snow White stopped. "Oh, no!" she cried. "There's a WALL!" 
    <br><br>
    And there was. A thick wall of ice! It gleamed in the light of the diamond dust.
    They shivered and backed away.
    <br><br>
    Then they saw some words scratched into the wall of ice. "I'll freeze your fingers, toes and nose.... unless my magic flower someone knows!"
    Snow White and Leona said all kinds of flowers. Wildflowers. Garden flowers. Flowers that grew in pots. 
    But none of them melted the ice!
    <br><br>
    "Whatever shall we do?" cried Snow White. "Wait!" said Leona. "There's one flower I haven't said yet! The flower that's like your name!"
    And Leona yelled, "SNOWDROPS!" very loud. 
    The ice wall sizzled and melted, leaving tiny globs of vanilla ice cream on the floor.

    Just then, they heard a sneeze. "ACHOOI". 
    They followed the sound….and found the dwarfs!
    <br><br>
    "I knew you'd save us," said Doc. Snow White shook her head. "It wasn't I," she said. 
    "It was Leona." "Hooray for Leona!" yelled the dwarfs.
    They all marched out of the mine.
    <br><br>

    They sang all the way home. When they arrived, Happy said, "Let's have a party to celebrate!"
    Everyone thought that was a good idea. Dopey and Sneezy hung decorations all around. 
    Grumpy and Doc made fruit punch to drink. Snow White put wildflowers on the table.
    <br><br>
    When everything was ready, they told stories, sang songs, and played blind man's bluff.
    Happy and Bashful danced the "miner's jig". 
    <br>

    <br>
    Everyone had a great time. Then it was time for Leona to go home. All the dwarfs kissed Leona goodbye. Dopey had a tear in his eye.
    <br><br>
    Leona touched the bright pink worm...And was home again! Leona wondered if the adventure with Snow White and the seven dwarfs was just a dream.
    But when Leona looked under the pillow, and knew it wasn't….because of what Leona found.
    <br><br>
    This certificate has been awarded<br>
    Because of Leona's kindliness, helpfulness and <br>
    other special qualities….<br><br>
    This document will certify and hereby state….<br><br>
    That Leona, <br><br>
    whose bravery and courage saved the day.
    <br><br>
    Has, today, been selected and thereby elected. 
    <br><br>
    AN HONORARY DWARF
    <br><br>
    Witnessed by... Snow White    
    Signed by... Doc, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy, Dopey, Sleepy and Bashful.
